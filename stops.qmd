Often times, a person's appearance unfortunately factors into how others treat them. Using data from the Stanford Open Policing Project, we use 400,000 traffic stops from New Orleans to find the difference in arrest rate between Black and White drivers adjusting for other variables. A potential weakness of our model is that the dataset is heavily modified from the actual study, and is reduced down to around 400,000 entries, therefore leaving out nearly 3.1 million entries. The deletion of the entries may have led to a misrepresentation of the population, and this would mess up our final predictions because it would be providing values that don't represent to the area, causing our entire model to be unrealistic.
